            <abstract>LC-06: Concentrated DisadvantageBrief description: Proportion of households located in census tracts with a high level of concentrated disadvantage, calculated using five census variablesIndicator category: Community Well-beingIndicator domain: Risk/OutcomeNumerator: Number of households with children less than 18 years of age located in census tracts of high concentrated disadvantageDenominator: Total number of households with children less than 18 years of agePotential modifiers: age, race, ethnicity, gender, geographic locationData source: American Community Survey (ACS)Notes on calculation: Concentrated disadvantage is calculated from five Census variables: 1) Percent of individuals below the poverty line, 2) Percent of individuals on public assistance, 3) Percent femaleheaded households, 4) Percent unemployed, 5) Percent less than age 18. The percentages of each individual indicator are z-score transformed. A Z-score transformation is achieved by subtracting the mean of the distribution from the variable value and dividing the difference by the standard deviation of the distribution. Z = (score - mean)/standard deviation. The resulting value should be averaged into an overall index of concentrated disadvantage or deprivation.More Information: https://amchp.org/amchp-resource-library/Distinct from similar uploads in that this layer uses 2020 Census tract geography and 2020 5 Year ACS data for calculation.
