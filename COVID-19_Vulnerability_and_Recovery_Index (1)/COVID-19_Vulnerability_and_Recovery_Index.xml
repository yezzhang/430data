            <abstract>The COVID-19 Vulnerability and Recovery Index uses Tract and ZIP
Code-level data* to
identify California communities most in need of immediate and long-term
pandemic and economic relief. Specifically, the Index is comprised of three
components — Risk, Severity, and Recovery Need with the last scoring the ability
to recover from the health, economic, and social costs of the pandemic.
Communities with higher Index scores face a higher risk of COVID-19 infection
and death and a longer uphill economic recovery. Conversely, those with lower
scores are less vulnerable. 

The Index includes one overarching Index score as well as a
score for each of the individual components. Each component includes a set of
indicators we found to be associated with COVID-19 risk, severity, or recovery
in our review of existing indices and independent analysis. The Risk component
includes indicators related to the risk of COVID-19 infection. The Severity
component includes indicators designed to measure the risk of severe illness or
death from COVID-19. The Recovery Need component includes indicators that
measure community needs related to economic and social recovery. The
overarching Index score is designed to show level of need from Highest to
Lowest with ZIP Codes in the Highest or High need categories, or top 20th or 40th percentiles of the Index, having the greatest need for support.

The Index was originally developed as a statewide tool but
has been adapted to LA County for the purposes of the Board motion. To
distinguish between the LA County Index and the original Statewide Index, we
refer to the revised Index for LA County as the LA County ARPA Index.

*Zip Code data has been crosswalked to Census Tract using HUD methodology



Indicators within each component of the LA County ARPA Index are:Risk:  Individuals without U.S. citizenship; Population Below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL); Overcrowded Housing Units; Essential Workers Severity:  Asthma Hospitalizations (per 10,000); Population Below 200% FPL; Seniors 75 and over in Poverty; Uninsured Population; Heart Disease Hospitalizations (per 10,000); Diabetes Hospitalizations (per 10,000)Recovery Need:  Single-Parent Households; Gun Injuries (per 10,000); Population Below 200% FPL; Essential Workers; Unemployment; Uninsured PopulationData are sourced from US Census American Communities Survey (ACS) and the OSHPD Patient Discharge Database.  For ACS indicators, the tables and variables used are as follows:
